# Data Modeling with Cassandra

This is the second Udacity Data Engineer NanoDegree project

## Introduction
The scenario is that a startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analysis team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, there is no easy way to query the data to generate the results, since the data reside in a directory of CSV files on user activity on the app.

The task is to have a data engineer create an Apache Cassandra database which can create queries on song play data to answer the questions. A Cassandra database is cerated for this analysis. The database is tested by running queries given by the analytics team from Sparkify to create the results.

## Project Overview
This project applies what has been learnt on the data modeling with Apache Cassandra lessons and completes an ETL pipeline using Python. The data is modelled and tables created in Apache Cassandra to run the queries.
